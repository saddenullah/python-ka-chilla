# when to use a comment in python ? mention in 10 study cases...

# answer ::: 1) Explain what code does
# Write a comment to tell what the code is doing.

# 2) Reminder for later (TODO)
# Use comments to remind yourself to fix or add something later.

# 3) Make hard code easy to understand
# If code is difficult, write a comment to explain it.

# 4) Say what a function does
# Write a small comment to explain what the function is for.

# 5) Explain function inputs
# Add comments to tell what input values the function needs.

# 6) Turn off code without deleting
# Use # to stop a line of code from running (just for testing or checking).

# 7) Write your name and date
# At the top, say who wrote the code and when.

# 8) Divide code into parts
# Use comments like # Step 1: Load data to make it clear.

# 9) Explain loops and if statements
# Write why you're using a loop or condition.

# 10) Give warnings or notes
# Use comments to tell if something is tricky or important.

# 6 rule of variable 


# 1: The varaible should contain only letters, numbers and underscore.
# 2: The variable should not start with a number.
# 3: the spaces are  not allowed in the variable name.
# 4: The variable name should be descriptive and short.
# 5: The variable name should not be a keyword in python.
# 6: case sensitivity is allowed in python.(should be lower case letter used)

# e.g

fruite_baset="manguos"
# fruite_baset=7
print(fruite_baset)
print(type(fruite_baset))
