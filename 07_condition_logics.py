# logical operatores are either "true or false" or "yes or no" or "on or off" or "1 or 0" or "

# equal to                    ==
# not equal to                !=
# greater than                >
# less than                   <
# greater than or equal to    >=
# less than or equal to       <=

# example
# 4 is equal  to 4
# TRUE
# print(4==4)
# print(5!=6)
# print(7>6)
# print(6<7)
# print(5>=4)
# print(4<=5)

# # False
# print(4==5)
# print(5!=8)
# print(7>8)
# print(6<9)
# print(5>=6)
# print(4<=3)

# application of logical operator
# hammad_age=4
# age_at_school=5
# print(hammad_age==age_at_school)
      
# hammad_age=5
# age_at_school=5
# print(hammad_age==age_at_school)

# inpu function and logical operators
hammad_age=input("how olod is hammad ")
age_at_school=5
hammad_age=int(hammad_age)
print(type(hammad_age))
print(hammad_age==age_at_school)
